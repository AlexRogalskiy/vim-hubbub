INTRODUCTION                                    *repoman*

Repoman is a plugin for creating and managing issues, pull requests, code
reviews, and more. "Managing" in this context can include commenting on,
reacting to, replying to, editing, closing, labeling, and so on. The intent
is to fully mirror the core functionality of GitHub in a Vim plugin.

COMMANDS                                        *repoman-commands*

Nearly all commands are contextually dependent on whether or not a repo is
"active". In the plugin, a repo is seen as active if the current buffer has
been opened from within a GitHub repo, or if you have navigated into a repo
view from the repo list view.

NOTE: All commands are contingent on the prior execution of :RepoManInit,
which initializes the state of the plugin in order to query public and
private repos for an authenticated user.

                                                *:RepoMan*
:RepoMan                Run the primary entrypoint command for Repoman and 
                        display the output. 

                        If this command _was_ run from within a Git 
                        repository, the plugin will display the current 
                        list of issues and pull requests for the repo.

                        If this command _was not_ run from within a Git
                        repository, the plugin will display the list of
                        repositories of which the authenticated user is a
                        member. From this view, pressing <Enter> on any
                        item in the list will generate a repository details
                        view identical to the one seen when running the
                        command from within a repository.
