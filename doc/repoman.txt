INTRODUCTION                                    *repoman*

Repoman is a plugin for creating and managing issues, pull requests, code
reviews, and more. "Managing" in this context can include commenting on,
reacting to, replying to, editing, closing, labeling, and so on. The intent
is to fully mirror the core functionality of GitHub in a Vim plugin.

COMMANDS                                        *repoman-commands*

Nearly all commands are contextually dependent on whether or not a repo is
"active". In the plugin, a repo is seen as active if the current buffer has
been opened from within a GitHub repo, or if you have navigated into a repo
view from the repo list view.

NOTE: All commands are contingent on the prior execution of :RepoManInit,
which initializes the state of the plugin in order to query public and
private repos for an authenticated user.

                                                *:RepoManInit*
:RepoManInit            Initialize the plugin with a GitHub authentication
                        token and a password to encrypt the token. 

                        This command only needs to be run once, and will allow
                        for indefinite use of the plugin, provided the token
                        is valid.

                        The password for encryption is a safety feature to
                        avoid having sensitive plaintext information on your
                        device. If OpenSSL v1.1.1 or later is available, the
                        PBKDF2 algorithm is used for key derivation.

                                                *:RepoMan*
:RepoMan                Run the primary entrypoint command for Repoman and 
                        display the output. A password prompt will appear, but
                        will not be required for any other commands as long as
                        the plugin is open.

                        If this command _was_ run from within a Git
                        repository, the plugin will display the current list
                        of issues and pull requests for the repo.

                        If this command _was not_ run from within a Git
                        repository, the plugin will display the list of
                        repositories of which the authenticated user is a
                        member. From this view, pressing <Enter> on any item
                        in the list will generate a repository details view
                        identical to the one seen when running the command
                        from within a repository.

KEY MAPPINGS                                    *repoman-maps*

These key mappings are available in all buffers, but some will do nothing if
used out of context. For example, "J" and "K" are used for navigating between
issues/comments/etc, but will do nothing when in the "Create Issue" buffer.

<Enter>                 In list view:
                            Open the item (issue/repo/etc) positioned under
                            the current cursor position.
                        In label view:
                            Select/deselect the label for the issue.

<BS> / <Backspace>      Similar to the "Back" button on a browser -- navigate
                        to the previous buffer. If the buffer is split to show
                        the details of an issue, hitting <Backspace> will
                        close the issue's buffer and refocus on the issue list
                        buffer.

H                       Navigate to the prev page of issues/comments/repos

J                       Move cursor to the next (down) issue/comment/label/repo

K                       Move cursor to the prev (up) issue/comment/label/repo

L                       Navigate to the next page of issues/comments/repos
